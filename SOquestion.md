I have a somewhat idiosyncratic design here and I want to confirm I am using the proper model specification. 

## Study design

There are ten plots which are long strips of land (rows in a soybean field), which were alternatingly assigned to treatment and control. In June, before treatment was applied, four soil samples were taken in each plot: two at a location 1/3 of the way down, and two at a location 2/3 of the way down. Some outcome variables were measured. Then the treatment was applied. Afterward, in September, four samples were taken again in the same locations.

The research question is whether the treatment affects the outcome variable. I guess it is most appropriate to start with a fully specified random effects structure so that we can control for variation in the x direction and the y direction.
